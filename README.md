# AOC-2022

Welcome to my Advent of Code[^aoc] 2022 project by [m-jaekel][github]

Puzzles are solved using the [Kotlin][kotlin] language.

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
